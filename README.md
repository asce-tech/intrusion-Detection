# Advancing Network Intrusion Detection with UNSW-NB15

## 📌 Project Objective

The UNSW-NB15 dataset plays a crucial role in advancing research on network intrusion detection. It is primarily used to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning models, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), in identifying and classifying different types of network attacks.

These attack categories include:
- **Probe**
- **R2L (Remote to Local)**
- **DoS (Denial of Service)**
- **U2R (User to Root)**

The dataset consists of 49 features capturing various aspects of network traffic, enabling model development and thorough experimentation. This project focuses on leveraging the UNSW-NB15 dataset to enhance intrusion detection and explore anomaly detection strategies for bolstering network security.
