# Project Name
 Advancing Network Intrusion Detection with UNSW-NB15

## Objective
The UNSW NB15 dataset plays a role in advancing research on network intrusion detection. Its primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning models like intrusion detection systems (IDS). Through this dataset, students can test how well these systems can identify and classify types of network attacks. These attacks are classified as Probe, R2L (Remote to Local) DoS (Denial of Service), and U2R (User to Root). With 49 features capturing aspects of network traffic, the UNSW NB15 dataset enables model development and thorough experimentation. Whether itâ€™s enhancing intrusion detection systems or exploring anomaly detection strategies, this dataset is crucial for bolstering network security.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network data.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.

### Libraries Used:

- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- Numpy for numerical computations.
- Seaborn for statistical data visualization.
- Matplotlib for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- Heat map to show relationships between variables in a dataset. It uses colors to represent values, making it easy to see patterns and trends.
- Sklearn for various machine learning algorithms, model evaluation, and data preprocessing techniques.
- XGBOOST for an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible, and portable.
